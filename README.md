### Bruins Random Line Generator

This is my first ever Github project. My goal is to develop a simple webpage to generate random line combinations for the Boston Bruins.
I have recently been studying the basics of web development and wanted to practice using html, CSS and Javascript. Throughout this project,
I also have utilized Git and Github for practice with version control.

**Objective:** To randomly generate new line combinations for the Boston Bruins

**How to Use:** Simply open the webpage and click the 'Randomize Lines' button to generate new line combinations.

**Programming Languages:** html, CSS, Javascript
